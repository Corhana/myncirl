	Minimum entry requirements are a grade C3 or above in two Higher level subjects, together with a D3 (Higher or Ordinary level) in four subjects. A minimum of grade D3 (Higher or Ordinary level) must be obtained in English. A grade D3 in Ordinary level Mathematics is required. However, NCI will accept a grade E in Higher level Mathematics once other requirements have been met. The grade E result will not be counted for points.
