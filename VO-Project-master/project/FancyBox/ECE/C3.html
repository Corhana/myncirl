			The report of the Expert Advisory Group on the National Early Years Strategy, established by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in October 2013; “Right from the Start” highlighted the need for training of leaders and managers in early years settings. The ECCE Scheme (free preschool year) also offers a higher capitation fee to pre-school service providers where all leaders hold a bachelor degree in childhood/early education (level 7 on the NFQ or equivalent) and have three years of experience in the sector. This indicates a government commitment towards a graduate-led workforce in ECE.
